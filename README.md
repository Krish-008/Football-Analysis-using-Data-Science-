Hello, 
🚀 Football, Data & Machine Learning – A Deep Dive into Player Performance! ⚽📊
As a huge fan of Cristiano Ronaldo, I’ve always admired the precision, dedication, and sheer dominance he brings to the game. That passion led me to explore football player analytics using data science & machine learning!
🔍 What I did:
✅ Analyzed a football dataset with player stats
✅ Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights
✅ Used K-Means Clustering to identify:
⚡ Top Playmakers
🎯 Top Strikers
🛡️ Top Defenders
🔥 Top Midfielders
✅ Built a Regression Model to predict future player performance
📈 The results? Some fascinating trends in player attributes, performance patterns, and a model that can estimate a player’s growth potential!
Football and AI—two of my biggest interests—coming together in one project. Excited to take this even further!
Would love to hear thoughts from fellow football & AI enthusiasts! ⚡⚽
